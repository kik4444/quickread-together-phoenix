# Quickread Together

My first Phoenix LiveView application for learning purposes. This is once again a rewrite of my Quickreader,
but with a twist! This time it supports multiple readers. Multiple people can open the page, paste in some text,
and read it quickly together.

## Features
- Realtime synchronization of text being read for all page visitors
- Indicator for number of readers
